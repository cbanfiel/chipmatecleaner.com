            <h4>Enhanced Washing</h4>
            <p>
              Chipmate thoroughly cleans poker and casino chips with a specially
              designed disinfecting solution. Our unique formula removes dirt
              and grime and eliminates up to 99.9% of bacteria and viruses while
              restoring chips’ original shine and texture

          <div class="content">
            <h4>High temperature treatment</h4>
            <p>
              Hot temperatures can neutralize bacteria and viruses, so Chipmate
              heats poker and casino chips to 150°F for extra sanitization and
              drying.

              disinfection to the next level. Commonly used to sanitize medical
              equipment, UV-C illumination is an effective method for destroying
              bacteria and viruses on surfaces.
